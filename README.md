The source code for the user study can be found in the folder `webInterface`.

The main code, the implementation of pairwise gaussian processes, 
is comprised of `gaussian_process.py`, `acquisition_function.py`, and `dataset.py`.  
For examples on how to use them, we refer `gp_utilities/utils_experiment.py` and to the `experiments` folder.  
There you can also find all experiments we ran for the paper.
